## 🎯 Our Mission
The prediction market space can be intimidating. Our focus is to provide the "missing manual" for the next generation of analysts and builders. We teach the mechanics, the math, and the strategy through a "learning by doing" philosophy—taking you from absolute zero to a base where you can innovate.

## 🏛️ The Learning Pillars
Our curriculum is structured into specialized modules, each building upon the last:

* **Fundamentals:** The core concept of "Skin in the Game" and binary event outcomes.
* **Pricing & AMMs:** Deep diving into Automated Market Maker math and share distribution.
* **Market Dynamics:** Identifying the roles of Informed Traders, Arbitrageurs, and Liquidity Providers.
* **Opportunity Markets:** Learning to spot and correct market inefficiencies.
